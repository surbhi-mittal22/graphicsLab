1. Make a 2x2 scaling matrix S as:
   Sx 0
   0  Sy
2. For each point of the polygon.
   (i) Make a 2x1 matrix P, where P[0][0] equals 
       to x coordinate of the point and P[1][0] 
       equals to y coordinate of the point.
   (ii) Multiply scaling matrix S with point 
        matrix P to get the new coordinate.
3. Draw the polygon using new coordinates.
